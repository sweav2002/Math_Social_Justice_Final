This repository contains my poster and presentation for my Math and Social Justice class.
I talk about anti-gay legislation and its impact on the mental health of teens.
Social media trends are also showcased through handmade visualizations.

We were given creative freedom when picking our final project topic and I wanted to 
pick something that I was passionate about.
